# Setting up Cleanbrowsing on your home devices
## What is cleanbrowsing?
As per the definition on the website
> A customizable DNS-based service that allows you to control what is accessible on your internet. Used by schools, municipalities, and parents to create safe browsing experiences for kids by controlling access to content like social media, pornography and other content deemed inappropriate.

For your information, DNS means Domain Name System and it is the phonebook of the Internet.
